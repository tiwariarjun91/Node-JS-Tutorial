// . means that we need the file in the current directory, it asks the user to look for the files in the current directory
check = require('./count');  //dont forget to use  quotes ''



//maybe a function cannnot return a concole.log function as a return value , so the return value should be given as a parameter to the log function

console.log(check(["Arjun", "Ram", "Krishna"]));

//this functionality is required to us in the count.js so will use the require function in that file
